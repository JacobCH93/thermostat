##Project Creating a Thermostat

### By Jacob Hanrahan

This is a project that involves creating a thermostat using JavaScript, I will be using the resorces provided and online resorses aswell.

The aim of this is to practice JavaScript and become more familiar with key concepts such as mathods classes and Jest tests.

For some reason I am not able to commit my modules file so if you need to clone  this you will need to install modules.
